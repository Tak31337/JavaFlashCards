Java Flash Cards
================

Java Flash Cards is a very simple swt-based application that reads a list of
strings and displays them as if they were part of a set of flash index cards.
It's a tool meant to assist in studying.

I created it in a night's work as an educational project with swt in order to
study for finals!

How to use
----------

The *.cards.txt files are structured in a very simple manner. A flash cards
consists of two different lines: the front side, and the back side:

 > Card 1 Front
 > Card 1 Back
 > Card 2 Front
 > Card 2 Back
 > Card 3 Front
 > Card 3 Back

You can make a list of cards with your favorite text editor. Just make sure it
has the right number of lines!

Every time you change cards, it will automatically display the front of the card
first. It may be a feature in the future to display the back as the default
instead, for a sort of "Jeopardy!" mode.
